# SillyScript
My custom made programming language.

The structure of programs written in this language (SillyScript) is exactly like java, only the keywords are different.
If there is anything which is not included in my programming language like JLabels and stuff(for now) you can write
pure java code and it will work.
All the keyWords in this programming language and their corresponding java language:- <br />
<br />**
SillyScript keyWord               - Java keyWord
IntricateEttiqutte                - class<br />
lengthenWith                      - extends<br />
JFrame                            - makeWindow<br />
includeFile                       - import<br />
integer                           - int<br />
groupOfCharacters                 - String<br />
character                         - char<br />
PrintToConsole()                  - System.out.println()<br />
Goofy Ahh Harry Potter Like Spell - public static void main<br />

I will include a demo code showing all these changes.
